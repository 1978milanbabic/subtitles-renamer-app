# Subtitles Renamer

**Electron-React App For Renaming Subtitles and Movie(Series) names**

The creation of this application is inspired by the fact that for many players the name of the video file must be the same as the name of the subtitle.
This can be especially tiring when you need to rename an entire season of a series.
The application tracks the name of video files and suggests renaming / shortening the title of both the movie and the subtitle.
